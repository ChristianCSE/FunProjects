GraphQL convention is to fetch lots of different types of objects 
from the same top-level node field. 

SQL dbs have diff tables for each type 
REST APIs use distinct endpoints per type 
=> Idiomatic GraphQL fetches ALL objs the same way; 
  hence, need GLOBALLY UNIQUE IDENTIFIER 
=> GraphQL cannot differentiate b/w User w/ id: 1 & Post w/ id: 1
